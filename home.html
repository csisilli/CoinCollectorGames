  <h3> A Brief Statment about the Game</h2>
  <p>This is a game just to collect coin's, it was a project for my Senior Project class. Where we make a large project which would be over 4,000 lines of code.</p>
  <p>
    We also will be following a coding standard with this project.
  </p>

      We will be only using this to move the character up, down, right, and left.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Once you click into the game, there will be a few options you can do with your character.
  </p>
  <br>

   <!--Div class to modify in css.-->
  <div class="names"></div>
  <img src ="images/name.JPG"  class ="mario"/>
</div>
  <p>
    From the image above, we have two different options. We can change the color of our character if it has not been taken and we can change our name.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p>Lastly, we can return home. </p>
  <p>We can click home button which is above Your Name.</p>
  <p> By clicking on Return to Top, it will bring us to the top of the page.</p>
