  <h2>Project Background</h2>

  <h4>For this project the purpose of it was for students, like me to get an understanding of large projects.</h4>
  <h4> As for a Computer Science Major, a large project is around 4,000 lines of code.</h4>
  <h4>The other important part of this project is documentation. It a detail explanation of the projects outline, instruction manual, design asspect, explaining the code, references, and a end summary of the project.</h4>

  <p>Which on this website, there will be no access to the documentation for privacy of the creator.</p>
  <br>

  <p>For my college class, as a Computer Science Major. It is require for the major to take Senior Project. With that in mind, we learn some skills when making a large project.</p>

  <h4> Due to my College, I am not sure if I am able to share their personal class descriptions. Which is what I will be referncing here.</h4>
  <br>

  <h3>The Reason I choose a Game Website</h3>

  <p>As a beginning programmer, I learn some skills throughout school some programming languages. With that in mind, there are some programming skills that I am better at and some that im still learning.</p>
  <p>The languages I was taught by two different schools were: C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Java, C, C#, and Javascript.</p>
  <p>With that in mind, during this semester I will be learning Javascript and I know bit of creating a website.</p>
  <p>With that, it left me with some options. Where I can make a website with some function and by doing some research on what I can make.</p>
  <p>I came up with making a video game on a website.</p>
  
  <h3>The complicated parts for this Project</h3>

  <p>When working on this project, there were a lot of things I didnt know what I was doing.</p>
  <p>I also ran into some errors along the way. Some I just personally didnt know at the time and some was just silly mistakes.</p>
  <p>The things I didnt know personally was using React and Firebase together.</p>
  <p>When running the program, I would always get an error about firebase. I just didnt know well enough.</p>
  <p>The other problem part of this project is that I wasnt familar with Firebase, Javascript, and making a game in general.</p>

  <p>With all this being said, I was able to make this project with a lot of reseach, and being able to learn Javascript at my school.</p>
